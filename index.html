  <h1 id="写在前面">神经网络</h1>
我一直对此十分感兴趣。以前写了一些模拟神经元的代码。但是很久没研究了，基本快忘了ann的算法原理。还特地研究了一下生物心理学和神经科学的基础知识。了解了一下人类大脑是处理信息的过程。

用计算机程序来模拟这一过程，十分疯狂的…不过目前已经有很多算法能模拟人类大脑一部分功能。人类的感情，公认是难以模拟的…

用计算机模拟人类学习、记忆和分析信息的能力还是可以达到的…好抽象。

应用领域其实都挺不靠谱的…什么这那的预测啊，什么xx的识别啊。比较像人类思维方式，人类思维方式就是有这个特点：不确定性。人类思考一个事情，得出的结论，不一定是最优的，但应该是一个能解决问题的结论。 最明显的例子，我们现在要去一个地方，有两条路都能到达。一条路近，但是不好走。另一条路，很整洁，但是远一些。我们走那条路呢？一般有“走最近的”的想法的人，就会选择最近的。但是，最近的路很乱，不好走。那有“路要好走”的想法的人会选择好走的路。 恩，人类就是擅长对这种“无确定结果”的“最佳答案”的分析上。 再具体点，咱们无时无刻都在做的事情。咱们的视觉信息，听觉信息，还有嗅觉信息，都是这么处理的。 比如看验证码，比如闻到一种酒香判断是什么酒，比如听音乐判断用的什么乐器。 即使是非常一致的结论，其实也是通过无数次这种思考，渐渐得到一个比较确定的结论的时候，才会每次都给出统一的结论。 比如计算1+1的时候，一个人从来没有计算过1+1，那么开始你就告诉他1+1=3，如果没人纠正他，那他这一生的1+1都会等于3了。




  <h1 id="写在前面">如何写学术论文</h1><p>最近正在写学术论文，无意间拜读到了一篇国外大牛的文章，里面详细的讲解了如何去组织、撰写一篇学术论文。我把这个文章原文放在这里，也加入了一些自己的理解，希望对看到这篇博客的人能有所帮助吧。。。</p>
<h1 id="Writing-Introductions"><a href="#Writing-Introductions" class="headerlink" title="Writing Introductions"></a>Writing Introductions</h1><p>There are many ways to introduce an academic essay or assignment. Most academic writers, however, appear to do one or more of the following in their introductions:</p>
<ul>
<li>establish the context, background and/or importance of the topic</li>
<li>indicate a problem, controversy or a gap in the field of study</li>
<li>define the topic or key terms</li>
<li>state of the purpose of the essay/writing</li>
<li>provide an overview of the coverage and/or structure of the writing </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Introduction的结构：背景，问题，目的，结构</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Examples of phrases which are commonly employed to realise these functions are listed below. Note that there may be a certain amount of overlap between some of the categories under which the phrases are listed.</p>
<p>Introductory sections for research dissertations, are normally much more complex than this and, as well as the elements above, may include the following: <code>a synopsis of key literature/current state of knowledge</code>, <code>synopsis of methods</code> ,<code>lists of research questions or hypotheses to be tested</code>, <code>significance of the study</code>, <code>recognition of the limitations of the study, reasons for personal interest in the topic</code>.</p>

<h2 id="Being-Critical"><a href="#Being-Critical" class="headerlink" title="Being Critical"></a>Being Critical</h2><p>As an academic writer, you are expected to be critical of the sources that you use. This essentially means questioning what you read and not necessarily agreeing with it just because the information has been published. Being critical can also mean looking for reasons why we should not just accept something as being correct or true. This can require you to identify problems with a writer’s arguments or methods, or perhaps to refer to other people’s criticisms of these. Constructive criticism goes beyond this by suggesting ways in which a piece of research or writing could be improved.<br><em>…..being against is not enough. We also need to develop habits of constructive thinking. Edward de Bono</em></p>

<h1 id="Reporting-Results"><a href="#Reporting-Results" class="headerlink" title="Reporting Results"></a>Reporting Results</h1><p>The standrard approach is to this section of dissertations is to <code>merely</code> present the results, without elaborate discussion or comment. This does not mean that you do not need any text to describe data presented in tables and figures. Writers usually comment on the significant data presented in the tables and figures. This often takes the form of the location or summary statement, which identifies the table or figure and indicates its content. This may be followed by a statement or statements which point out and describe the relevant or significant data. All your tables should be numbered and given a title.</p>
<p>More elaborate commentary on the results is normally restricted to the <strong>Discussion section</strong>. In research articles, however, authors may comment extensively on their results as they are presented, and it is not uncommon for the Results section to be combined with the Discussion section under the heading: Results and Discussion. </p>

  五一前夕，小清清提议去找她弟弟玩，她弟和她弟媳都在顺德勒流打工，刚好五一前最后一天他们准备辞职，所以我俩立马动身前去找他们玩。麻烦的是没有从深圳直达勒流的高铁，而从广州中转去勒流的车票也卖完了，所以我们只能坐大巴去。在车站等车的时候，我们想得到大巴可能会晚点到，却没想多会晚点将近1个半钟。小清清又饿又气，喊着要去退票回宿舍，不过还是被我和退票口的人员给劝回来了。好不容易等来了大巴，却没想多噩梦才刚来临。在通往勒流的路上，大巴必须得经过一座虎门大桥，然而我们却在这段路赛车将近3个小时。大巴走走停停，破车顶盖抖的响声让人心烦，而且小清清不仅晕车，还很想上厕所。小清清那个难受啊，我就在她旁边却什么都帮不上，晕车药也没带。我又一次在旅途中没能照顾好小清清:-(。终于熬到勒流下车后，我们都决定以后不再坐大巴了。在酒店休息了一晚，第二天我们就开始和她弟和弟媳一起出来玩了。吃必胜客，逛街给农村家里的小孩子买衣服，吃勒流特产双皮奶，不过双皮奶太甜了，没想象中那么好吃。。
